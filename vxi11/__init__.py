"""
An implementation of the VXI-11 protocol for python.

This is not necessarily the most accurate representation of the VXI-11
specification, but it is simple.

The thread-safe nature (or lack thereof) has not been explored.  Deviations of
this implementation to the VXI-11 specification have not been investigated. 

Requires python 2.3
